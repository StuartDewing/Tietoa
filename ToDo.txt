- Register dependency | Dependency Injection
- Add IF Statement to Action

Team Controller
	- Add AutoMapper
	
PlayerController
All Remaining are service based
    - return NotFound();
    - Refactor request to be a service
    - Refactor Dto Mapping to be a service

Matt Notes:
   - That service method needs to be public not private.
   - Separately as you are not yet using DI, you'll need to new up the service in your controller, and remove the static from the method
